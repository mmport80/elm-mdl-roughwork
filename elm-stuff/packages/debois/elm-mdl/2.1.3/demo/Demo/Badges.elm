> The Material Design Lite (MDL) badge component is an onscreen notification
> element. A badge consists of a small circle, typically containing a number or
> other characters, that appears in proximity to another object. A badge can be
> both a notifier that there are additional items associated with an object and
> an indicator of how many items there are.
> 
> You can use a badge to unobtrusively draw the user's attention to items they
> might not otherwise notice, or to emphasize that items may need their
> attention. For example:
> 
>  - A "New messages" notification might be followed by a badge containing the
> number of unread messages.  
>  - A "You have unpurchased items in your shopping cart" reminder might include
>  a badge showing the number of items in the cart.
>  - A "Join the discussion!" button might have an accompanying badge indicating the
> number of users currently participating in the discussion.  
> 
> A badge is almost
> always positioned near a link so that the user has a convenient way to access
> the additional information indicated by the badge. However, depending on the
> intent, the badge itself may or may not be part of the link.
> 
> Badges are a new feature in user interfaces, and provide users with a visual clue to help them discover additional relevant content. Their design and use is therefore an important factor in the overall user experience.
